' Description:
'   This macro reads configuration data from a sheet named "SFTP". The "SFTP" sheet should
'   have headers in row 1 with the following columns:
'       A: Client Name
'       B: Data Sheet Name
'       C: New File Name (without extension)
'       D: File Path (where the CSV file will be saved)
'
'   For each row in the SFTP sheet (starting from row 2), the macro performs the following:
'       1. Reads the client name, data sheet name, new file name, and file path.
'       2. Opens the specified data sheet and assumes its header is in row 1.
'       3. Finds the column positions for the following headers in the data sheet:
'          "Client", "Cusip_ISIN", "Security_Name", "Valuation_Type", and "Price".
'       4. Loops through the data sheet rows (starting from row 2) and selects only the rows
'          where the "Client" column matches the client name from the SFTP sheet.
'       5. Copies the matching rows (only the specified columns) into a new workbook.
'       6. Saves the new workbook as a CSV file using the provided file path and new file name.
'
'   This macro is useful for filtering and exporting data for individual clients based on a
'   configuration provided on the "SFTP" sheet.
'
' How It Works:
'   - The macro defines the SFTP sheet and determines its used range.
'   - It loops through each configuration row (ignoring the header) to retrieve export settings.
'   - For each configuration, it accesses the corresponding data sheet and identifies required 
'     columns by matching header names.
'   - It then filters the data sheet by the specified client and copies the desired columns to
'     a new workbook.
'   - Finally, it saves the new workbook as a CSV file and repeats the process for all configuration rows.
